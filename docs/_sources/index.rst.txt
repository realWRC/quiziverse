QUIZIVERSE documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for the QUIZIVERSE web application. Quiziverse is a userfriendly
quiz application that allows users to create, edit and answer quizzes. All the quizzes are also
exposed through a RESTful API for users to impliment in their own application. You can clone the
repository and run the application for yourself `here <https://github.com/realWRC/quiziverse/tree/master>`_.
